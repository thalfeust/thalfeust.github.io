# Professional projects
## [PFE] - Colaborative Robot - COBOT
For 6 months, I worked in a team of 4 trainees (miself included) for two companies: Avisto and Elsys Design. The main goal of this project was to create a **collaborative robot**, a **COBOT**, meaning a robot that interacts directly with humans. That means the system had to prevent collisions and always know where obstacles were located.
To create this system we have programmed a Computer Vision system, based on a set of image processing to provide a real-time control of the robot's position taking into account the presence of obstacles.

## Data analist for a team of reasearcher
For a month, I joined a team of researchers who were testing their solution, based on a new technology (protected by a confidentiality agreement) in order to start its industrialization.
My main activity was the analysis, writing and testing of **Matlab scripts**. In addition, I had to provide data analysis on a weekly basis to allow the team to adapt future tests to the results obtained.

# Tutored projects
## Data Science (Machine Learning)
For 6 weeks, I worked with a team of 6 internationals students on a **Machine Learning** projects. The main objective of the tutored project was to create **Neural Network** models to provide image analysis of the inside the human colon.
To accomplish this task, we created two models:
- a **Covoloutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify pictures into categories,
- a **U-Net model** to apply a pixel segmentation allowing the detection of polyps.

## Computer Vision & Robotic
For two months, I worked on a tutored project whose objective was to provide a program allowing a robot (in a simulator) to follow a sign in space (3D) using a camera. In short, the objective was that a robot with a mounted camera stays in front of a moving sign in order to leave the sign in the center of the image (camera).
This project is devided in two parts:
- **Computer Vision** program to detect and track the sign in space,
- **Robotic Kinematic** to move the robot.

## Artificial Intelligence
For 2 months, I worked on a tutored project whose objective was to provide a robot (built from a LEGO-Mindstorm pack) able to solve a skoban game. 
This project is devided in two parts:
- a **Solver** based on the **Graph Theory**;
- a **embedded program** to control the robot.

# Personal projects
## Mutated Genetic Based Neural Network (MGNN) - Snakegen

For 6 months I worked with an engineer friend on a personal project. During our spare time, we developed a **JavaScript** program to trained a **Neural Network (NN)** to play the Snake game.
Because we wanted to get to know a new type of NN, we choose to use the **Mutated Genetic Based Neural Neural Network** (**MGNN**) to train our model, called **Snakegen**.
